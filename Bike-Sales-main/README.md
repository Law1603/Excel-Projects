# Steps taken
• Data Cleaning: Given the structured nature of the dataset,  any missing, inconsistent, or erroneous values  have been addressed.

• Data Transformation:The 'Age Brackets' column seems to be derived from the 'Age' column, categorizing individuals into age groups.
The data might have been aggregated to generate the insights presented in the dashboard.

•Visualization: Based on the dashboard, various visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and trend lines were created to represent the data in a more comprehensible manner.

# Summary of Findings
